        <h3>My First Blog</h3>
        <p>The Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor is an American twin-engine, jet-powered, all-weather, supersonic stealth fighter aircraft. As a product of the United States Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also incorporates ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22 airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while program partner Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems</p>

        <h3>My Second Blog</h3>
        <p>First flown in 1997, the F-22 descended from the Lockheed YF-22 and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. It replaced the F-15 Eagle in most active duty U.S. Air Force (USAF) squadrons. Although the service had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs to replace its entire F-15 fleet, it later scaled down to 381, and the program was ultimately cut to 195 aircraft – 187 of them operational models – in 2009 due to political opposition from high costs, a perceived lack of air-to-air threats at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35 Lightning II.[N 2] The last aircraft was delivered in 2012.</p>

        <h3>My Third Blog</h3>
        <p>The F-22 is a critical component of the USAF's tactical airpower as its high-end air superiority fighter. While it had a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the aircraft became the service's leading counter-air platform against peer adversaries. Although designed for air superiority operations, the F-22 has also performed strike and electronic surveillance, including missions in the Middle East against the Islamic State and Assad-aligned forces. The F-22 is expected to remain a cornerstone of the USAF's fighter fleet until its succession by the Boeing F-47.[3][4]</p>

        <h3>My Fourth Blog</h3>
        <p>The program formally moved to full-scale development, or Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD), in August 1991. The production F-22 design (internally designated Configuration 645) had also evolved to have notable differences from the YF-22, which was immature due to being frozen relatively soon after the complete redesign in the summer of 1987.[N 7] While the overall layout was similar, the external geometry saw significant alterations; the wing's leading edge sweep angle was decreased from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted rearward and decreased in area by 20%.[25] The radome shape was changed for better radar performance, the wingtips were clipped for antennas, and the dedicated airbrake was eliminated.</p>
